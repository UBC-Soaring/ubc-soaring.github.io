This meeting featured guests from the University Soaring Society from Toronto Metropolitian University who offered to tell us a bit more about their club operation. They are an organized university soaring club and can serve as a model for our operation.

# Locations for Gliding

- Vancouver Island
  - Has to be reached by boat
- Hope
  - Farther away from YVR and surrounding airspace; less busy

# Reaching out to Clubs

- Highest priority for the existence of our club
- Ask clubs around Metro Van if some of our members can join their clubs - try to get people interested
  - Avoid just straight up ask clubs if we can use facilities
  - Visit Vancouver Soaring Club to gauge their interest in having a regular student presence at their facility
    - If the club is interested, we can then proceed with trying to get help from UBC staff and other resources
- **Toronto Soaring Club**
  - Some members are faculty of their school; they have had leverage in funding and club establishment as a result
    - This was critical for the formation of the club

# Club promotion

- **Toronto Soaring Club**
  - Had planned to get a glider for their outreach day
    - Could possibly (?) work for UBC Soaring on Imagine Day if we build a rapport with Vancouver Soaring Club
- RCAC
  - Untapped potential; can use students who used to be in RCACs who have PPL or gliding experience to help mentor new pilots

# Long term goals

- **Vancouver Soaring Club**
  - Essentially to provide opportunities for students to be able to glide (students pay their own way to licenses).
  - No plans for a dedicated training program - may possibly become a thing in the future.
  - Sim training can be taught by some instructors from the Vancouver Soaring Club if we establish a connection with them
  - If our club becomes strong enough, we _may_ be able to compete with other clubs in the country for cross country etc.

# Intro flight

- 4(+1) people have expressed interest in an intro flight - may potentially happen Mid-May
