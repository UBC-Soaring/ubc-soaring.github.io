**TL;DR, see [Positions](#positions). To nominate yourself, see [Nominations](#nominations).**

Based on the conclusions of the [last meeting](/minutes/2024/04-10-Weekly-Meeting-minutes), we will be looking for
executives to run for various positions to support the operations of a club. Personally, my goal as acting president is
to make it easy for club members to get involved and shape the club into what they want. To this end, I decided to make
sure that meeting minutes are accessible on this public website, for example, and encourage regular weekly meetings.
At this point, we also need more people around to help out with club duties (mostly sending emails and writing documents
like this right now), so we decided it makes sense to form a semi-official exec team.

None of the appointed execs would have any substantial power given the current loose organization of the group, but
would instead be the "go to" person for certain things. Time commitment and the nature of the commitment will vary
heavily depending on the role, but they should be manageable even with a busy schedule.

# Voting
As acting president, I will select the exec team manually since we don't have critical mass to hold a proper election as
decided in the last meeting. **If you are interested in more than one role, please apply for more than one!** If more
than one person applies for the same role, I will favor having more people on the exec team to spread the workload. For
example, if I have two people applying for spot A, but one of the people has also applied for spot B, I will give spot A
to the person who only applied for spot A, and spot B to the person who applied for A and B.

If there is a lot of competition and choices are not clear, I will hold a public vote.

# Positions
## President
* I am serving as the acting president and will continue to do so until we hold a formal election, which will be
probably around the new year once we have a decent number of active club members. For reference, here's a rough idea of
what the goals and expectations are:
* Call and oversee meetings
* Oversee club operations
* Delegate tasks to exec team where appropriate
* Ensure that club rules/bylaws are followed (and write them)
* Ensure that the club is performing safe and legal operations
* Coordinate interactions with the school/AMS
* Heavy work load

## Treasurer
* Since we don't actually have any money, work would likely be light for the time being. This would likely pick up a bit
if we 
* Write and manage club budget
* Manage club bank accounts (if we get one)
* Manage and track all club assets (ex, who has the simulator parts)

## VP Marketing ("Social Media Coordinator")
* Responsible for social media presence
* Create accounts on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, maybe TikTok and make content for these accounts
* Figure out how to get on AMS CampusBase
* Website announcements, but other roles would likely make their own
* Work would likely be moderate during the summer and early fall semester as we try to promote the club for incoming
freshmen, then fairly light.

## VP External ("Outreach Coordinator")
* Reaching out to gliding clubs in the Lower Mainland, other gliding related areas
* Coordinate operations with external soaring clubs, keep tabs on soaring operations (fixed wing, handgliding, and
paragliding) in the area
* Moderate work during the summmer and fall semesters as we try to coordinate something with soaring organizations
  * After that, duties would likely involve staying accountable with whichever club we partner with and keeping tabs on
  the soaring community

## VP Internal ("Events Coordinator")
* Coordinate sim nights, networking, social gatherings
* Help coordinate ride shares to airports, but indvidual club members will likely do a lot of this on their own
* Work would be very light over the summer, then light during the year as we plan the occasional activity

## Secretary
* The secretary simply needs to show up to most meetings and take notes
* See notes from the [last meeting](/minutes/2024/04-10-Weekly-Meeting-minutes) for an example... I didn't take these ;)
* Work is consistent and only during that fixed period of time when meetings take place
