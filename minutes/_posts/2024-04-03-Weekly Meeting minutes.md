* Results of soaring club survey; This was the one linked on the poster
* This was the one linked on the poster; Conclusions:
*   Mixed year levels (nothing stands out). Naturally, 4th years have a bit less interest
*   ~1/3 of people in the club have a pilot’s license or some experience; People in the “Other” category largely provided specific details on pilot’s certs
*   People with licenses are all from Canada (a bit surprising, honestly)
*   The labels got cut off for the club leadership one, so here they are:
    *   Orange – Yes, but don’t know what to do
        
    *   Green – Yes, and have leadership experience
        
    *   Red – Yes, and have experience with the AMS
        
*   There is a substantial body of people willing to help with club leadership
*   People are most interested in funding assistance for flying
    *   Probably can’t do this directly with or without AMS support – AMS has tight budget
        
    *   Are external funding opportunities per-person; Could support application

    *   In the states: [https://www.ssa.org/junior-soaring/](https://www.ssa.org/junior-soaring/)
        
*   More people are interested in conventional soaring (rather than para/hang gliding), though support exists for all of them
*   Also broad support for a groupchat and ride share coordination
        
# AMS rejection
*   Club applied with 21 signatures; Was rejected by AMS.
*   “_Feedback: The Operations Committee denied your application as it is too similar to the Aviation Club, and its purpose is not well-represented in the proposed events. We encourage you to rethink some of your purposes for starting an AMS club and apply again._
    _Policies in Violation: Section 4.2.a.v: The club's mandate does not overlap with the mandate of an existing AMS subsidiary The members of either the Clubs and Societies Working Group or Operations Committee have read and discussed your application thoroughly before arriving at this conclusion. We appreciate the time and eﬀort you’ve put into this application and would like to remind you that we will have another round of New Club Applications in June 2024. Applications that show improvement or utilize our feedback in the second attempt reﬂect positively and may give your club the boost it needs. There are also numerous student groups that operate successfully outside of the AMS. We encourage you to explore your interests and continue with your club idea beyond this moment. If you have any questions, feel free to email me (avpadmin@ams.ubc.ca) or our Clubs Administrator, Amy ([clubsadmin@ams.ubc.ca](mailto:clubsadmin@ams.ubc.ca))._”
*   Form was submitted in Qualtrics; No way to view the form before completing, no way to download responses, and single-line inputs in many places. This made it difficult to enter data or argue anything. Also, we don’t have a record of the application. What I do remember from the form:
*   Club purpose was along the lines of promoting soaring among the UBC campus, and providing affordable access… Something like that
*   Club events were:
    *   Intro flight day – Bring newcomers to airport and focus on their needs; help subsidize intro flights with a certified instructor so they can find out if soaring is for them.
    *   Soaring simulator night – Help promote soaring on campus by having an open simulator night (advertised event) for people to use the simulator (if we built one)
    *   Club social meetup – Help build the group spirit that soaring is known for
*   Made a case that powered flight and career-related interests attract a different community with very different needs from glider flight; Different airports, different aircraft, different costs, usually different areas (and relatively limited airspace)
    *   Noted that aviation club free membership to PFC conveys no benefit to glider pilots; Would be awkward to split financial resources on powered flight stuff & glider stuff
*   Did not mention VOC overlap with Ski and Board, diving club, surfing club, etc. as precedent for overlapping clubs; This could make a stronger case
*   Do not understand the note about the events not aligning with mission; These events are literally designed to introduce people on campus to soaring and the community at various levels, starting from simulator/social stuff to taking an intro flight
*   Probably better to not affiliate with AMS anyway; Legal issues, can’t fly
*   New AMS clubs don’t get funding or club rooms
*   BUT – It’s hard to book rooms. Sent ~8 emails to try to get room on campus, can only get library study rooms. If the club gets bigger, we could meet at a Vancouver Public Library meeting room: [https://www.vpl.ca/facilities/branch-meeting-rooms](https://www.vpl.ca/facilities/branch-meeting-rooms)
*   Also difficult to promote: See promotion

# Opportunities for soaring     
##   Conventional soaring
*   [https://vancouversoaring.com/](https://vancouversoaring.com/)
*   In a fixed-wing aircraft; simply doesn’t have an engine
*   2 hr drive away – Hope airport
*   Looking to do ride share for the summer, continue into year – Modo/evo
        
##   Para/hang gliding
*   [https://www.westcoastsoaringclub.com/](https://www.westcoastsoaringclub.com/)
*   Don’t know much about this
*   Webpage has events section; Community in vancouver
        
#  Soaring simulator
*   I’ve built one before [https://hackaday.io/project/186513-flight-simulator-from-scrap](https://hackaday.io/project/186513-flight-simulator-from-scrap)

*   Could build another, have been amassing parts
*   Great promotional tool – Imagine day
*   Would be nice to try and put it on the ground floor of the nest for an event
*   Where to put it? Aviation club trying to get room, maybe
    *   Space outside gaming club?
*   Gaming club has an event thing, could advertise there
        
#   Promotion
*   Social media – Haven’t done this yet since it doesn’t make sense if we’re not doing anything; Should do this now
*   CampusBase – How to get access? See MOU below
*   Website – Should set up a website for visibility
*   Imagine Day – Heavy metal club got into Imagine Day without being AMS affiliated or with a MOU – Need to figure out how
        
#   MOU – Common Energy
*   Common Energy (unrelated to soaring) is an unaffiliated club, gets funding separately
*   Talked to president:
    me| Hey, I was just curious, I was wondering how Common Energy is affiliated? Is this an AMS club? Is it formally affiliated with AMS Sustainability, or just receiving funding? I'm having problems with the AMS when it comes to club-related stuff, so I was just wondering how CE is operating since that kind of model might make more sense in my case...
    CE| Common Energy is unconsituted, so we are not an AMS club. We're an affiliated organization that signed an memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the AMS. Our funding comes from the MOU which pulls from AMS Sustainability funding that is open to all clubs to apply. The MOU we signed grants us free nest bookings, but becoming unconsituted would mean losing the benefits that clubs have in relationship to the AMS
*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum\_of\_understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding)
*   Might be the most viable option for the Soaring Club
        
#   Discord
*   Does email like groups.io work better? Probably not, use email for official things
*   Cross-linking – Apparently, there’s a way to link discord chats so announcements come through. Should link w/ aviation club
*   Aviation club discord isn’t widely known by the looks of it… Should encourage them to make a post on Instagram, or send an email…
*   Discord has a school discovery feature, should find a way to associate with UBC on that
        
#   Next Meeting
*   One or two weeks? One, because final schedule
*   Room location? Trying to get room with AV system. These rooms can’t be rented by normal students – Note from after meeting, the next mtg will be in the same location (IKB 265)
*   Webcam – Want better image. Look for wide angle camera
*   Post agenda ahead of time that people can edit
*   Attendance form – Record how many ppl show up
*   Legal Stuff – If we drive people to soaring and promote it, are we liable?
*   Everyone would be signing waiver from soaring club
*   But, could somebody sue club members for being “misleading” about risks?
*   Clarify: Club members should not be taken as authority in subject; Nobody is expert
*   Do we need legal protection from this?
*   Want a summary of meeting; Post PDF. You’re reading it!
