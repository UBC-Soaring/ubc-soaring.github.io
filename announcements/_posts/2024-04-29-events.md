Based on everyone's feedback in the when2meets, a few upcoming events have been scheduled. For one, our **weekly
meetings** for the summer semester will be held on **Sundays at 7pm.** As always, a virtual link will be provided for
those who cannot attend in person. Our weekly meetings are an excellent opportunity to get to know other club members
and learn what's happening in the soaring community, so we would encourage you to attend. Your feedback is also a great
help to shape club operations. Location is still TBD, though (probably IKB room 265 again).

Next, thanks to our new simulator gear, we will be holding our first **Open Simulator Night** this Thursday at 6pm in
IKB room 265. This is a great opportunity for new and experienced pilots to build their skills and practice. We will be
using the [Condor soaring software](https://www.condorsoaring.com/), which is generally regarded as the best
soaring-specific software. We'll have a flight stick and 180 degree monitor setup.

Finally, we're also considering take our first **trip out to the airport** in Hope on the weekend of May 11th, weather
permitting. If you're interested in joining the carpool or attending any of these events, consider joining the club:
